# Glass-Design-UI

[Live Deployment](https://glassdesign.netlify.app/)

This website showcases the profile of user's (aka 'ME') gaming dashboard and uses a glass design layout which provides a clean look. Also, for the progress bars, I wanted to add animation to it without using javascript so I implimented CSS Animations to do that.
